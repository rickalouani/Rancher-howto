**Four ways to build Kubernetes clusters with Rancher 2.0**

Making the leap to micro-services is not as daunting as it was even 10 years 
ago. The abundance of information and case studies shared by many companies 
that went through the trials and tribulations helped establish solid industry 
best practices. Coupled with many new great open-source tools donated or 
developed and supported by a great community of contributors took the mystery 
out of the process. In this article, I am going to demonstrate two great 
opensource tools that I am confident can make your adoption of micro-services 
less challenging. Kubernetes, arguably the best open source container 
orchestrator available and Rancher 2.0 to bootstrap and manage custom Kubernetes
clusters.  
A Kubernetes Cluster is a great habitat for micro-services. The platform 
provides a wealth of built in functionality and solutions and supported by
a wonderful opensource community and a huge ecosystem. It also provides a great 
API that you can leverage to customize your clusters or to use as a baseline for
your own [extending Kubernetes]. 
Rancher 2.0 as I will demonstrate makes customizing, bootstrapping, and managing
a Kubernetes cluster a breeze. I will use it to deploy a Kubernetes cluster 
four different ways:

**1. RKE(Rancher Kubernetes Engine) to build a 5 node cluster from scratch on DigitalOcean**

**2.  Import the management of an existing GKE(Google Kubernetes Engine) to Rancher 2.0**

**3.  RKE on AWS**  

**4.  Custom cluster using VMs**

Many of the early adopters were thriving companies (Amazon, Google,
Netflix, ...), growing fast and the outlook was great. They were having to 
scale up their resources to meet demand, unfortunately most the scaling was 
Vertical. It became apparent to them that adding more data centers to meet 
demand was cost prohibitive, and logistically not practical. Furthermore, some 
of these companies' own metrics were showing capacity usage hovering around 
20% at peak. They realized they were heading towards a scalability nightmare, 
and who wouldn't. Conceptually, it took them 5 data centers to service the same 
number of requests as would a single data center where resources are managed 
appropriately. The problem was clearly defined CPU core, and Memory need to be 
managed better, simple, right? 
To make a long story short, The problem was a direct result of the monolithic 
architecture used to develop software. The way applications were developed, 
built, packaged, and executed was at the heart of the problem. An application 
was the end product of thousands of line of code developed over many years by 
many developers, compiled, and built into an executable, and packaged together 
with library files. When the application is installed and executed as a 
monolith that runs and dies as a single entity, allocating resources for it 
was the responsibility of OS and under the mercy of the quality of the source code. 
Functions within the application, shared the same CPUs, Shared Memory, and Storage local 
or remote. When whole systems were crashing because of a memory leak caused by some badly 
written trivial function It became obvious that any solution selected had to include
a new software design paradigm where applications are divided into smaller more managable 
modules that could be managed independetly(containers) and the ability to assign resources 
at a finer granularity to application modules directly.
The current covention is as follows:
   * A CPU core is divided into units of m (millicpu). The idea is quite simple, 
     when a function foo is assigned 200m vCPU, all it means is that 
     the underlying OS scheduler is supposed to service our function requests at 
     least 20% of of the time while running. If foo runs for the 5 min we can be 
     confident that foo received least one minute of CPU, if the system is not busy,
     the OS might give foo more resources but that is not guaranteed. 
   * Memory and Storage are straight forward with only one minor detail, the units are in bytes 
     and you can specify exact number like 1G(billion bytes) E,P,T,G,M,K or in binary 
     1Gi(gigabyte) Ei, Pi, Ti, Gi, Mi, Ki. The goal was the ability to assign exact 
     dedicated resources to application functions vs all the functions sharing single 
     resources. 
The overall solution they each came up with shared similar concepts and directly 
Containers and Container orchestration. Linux provided the tools necessary(NAMESPACES, 
CGROUPS,) to provide separation of concerns one of the core principle in the 
the micro-services architecture. Applications had to be divided into smaller 
more manageable services that could be developed independently and communicate
with each other using a common API. However, breaking up the monolith did not 
simplify the situation, it complicated it enormously. With a monolith, you 
install it configure it and run it. All the pieces are built and packaged 
together (executables and libraries). interactions between application modules 
was straight forward because all the pieces were installed together on the same 
host and share the same OS resources such as RPC, thread management, message 
queues, etc. The OS was also responsible for Scheduling and managing resources.
Breaking down the monolith presented a different challenge. How are all these 
newly packages pieces of my application are going to communicate and work with 
each other to produce at least the same functionality and reliability my 
monolith? if these micro-services can run independently and can be assign 
resources why not go further and develop the ability to have them run on 
different hosts, maybe even on different networks. The result is containers and 
container orchestration. Kubernetes was devolopped by google to solve the 
container orchestration puzzle. What I am hoping to accomplish here in this 
article is to help you setup a Kubernetes cluster to help give you a test bed 
where you can experiment with containers as you create them. You will have a 
play ground where you can take your newly made containers on test drives. 
The Diagram below highlights some of Kubernetes features and how it provides
a solid platform for a successful migration to micro-services.

A Kubernetes cluster is a collection of resources(hosts, storage, and great 
technologies(docker, SDN, CNI, RESTful API design) integrated together 
beautifully.Kubernetes emboddies the concept of the DATA CENTER as a computer. 
Once provisioned, Kubernetes will abstract away the complexity of managing 
multiple hosts and present a multinode cluster as a single entity. A user would 
submit a desired state of workloads in the form of a yaml manifest and the API server 
will store the manifest in it's data store ETCD. When the scheduler finds a node with 
enough free resources to satisfy a request the workload would get scheduled on that node.
A watch loop constantly compares the current state and the desired state(stored in ETCD)
and if they vary kubelet(kubernetes agent on the nodes) will inform the API server.
The API server will engage the appropriate controller to bring the current state in line with
the desired state.

The tools avaialbe for bootstraping a Kubernetes cluster such as KOPS, 
KUBEADM, conjure-up, kube-spray, and MINIKUBE are great tools for standing up 
a cluster, and do make the process very easy. However, they are CLI based,  
and do require Linux skills and configuration and scripts would have to be version controlled. 
In this article I would love to demonstrate Rancher 2.0  you to give
[Rancher 2.0]: http://rancher.com/rancher2-0/  a try as a tool to bootstrap new or import existing Kubernetes clusters
and Manage them through a friendly and very intuitive WebUI or using Rancher 2.0
CLI. 

Rancher 2.0 is an opensource container orchestration platform that works very well with
Kubernetes. It is a great tool for standing up a Kubernetes cluster. It allows the user
to customise the cluster(s) through either Rancher 2.0 CLI or through a friendly and intuitive
WebUI.
The user can select the size of the deployment(number of nodes) and how to deploy each node
(ETCD, MASTER, or WORKER) it also gives guideline on the number of ETCD nodes in the ETCD cluster.
Note that tool forces an ODD number of nodes (1,3,or 5) which is an industry best practice in 
leader elected clusters. The odd number ensures a clear majority in case of a cluster split. 

![](https://github.com/rickalouani/Rancher-howto/blob/master/Rancher-screen-shots/addnodes.png)

provides the user with access to configuration variables, API endpoints, among other things
its own Kuberentes Engine RKE(Rancher Kubernetes Engine), and allows the user 
to create, manage, and monitor multiple kubernetes clusters across different cloud 
providers from a single UI. It also allows a user to import existing Kubernetes clusters 
asÂ I will demonstrate later in the article.

*   assumption: User has already configured Rancher 2.0 < will add links to how-to-docs>


**RKE(Rancher Kubernetes Engine) to build a 5 node cluster from scratch on DigitalOcean**

 The goal of this demonstration is to build a Kubernetes cluster with 1 Master(control node), 
 1 etcd(to store cluster and workload configuration) and  3 worker nodes(to run our microservices). 
 The basic architecture is bellow
